Positive Positive Against Covid

We are proposing a # CPAP portable, low cost and easily scalable helmet, composed by:

- Head Bubble - with a neck juncture and ring, motor and blower and valves;
- Control System with pressure sensor;
- Extra features for symptoms monitoring: temperature and ECG sensors;
- Safety chamber CO2 concentration 
- Mobile App
- Alert System

This device facilitates respiration while avoiding the spread of the virus and with the mobile app allows an easy monitoring of the device and of relevant data regarding the patient health state.

Our project can be adaptable regarding the costs needs, for example, the ECG sensor is not mandatory, and can be scaled to developing countries.

Also, with the adding of one sensor at the way out we can easily, in the future, upgrade our CPAP helmet into a BiPAP and provide an assisted ventilation. This is really relevant because CPAP are really useful in hospitals but, even in non crisis situations, but in the particularly COVID-19 situation, BiPAP helmets are used whenever it is possible.

With our project we want to provide a low cost a device, also adaptable to be used in developing countries and critical situations that: 

Minimizes the spread of the corona virus in hospitals environments;
 
Reduces the need of ventilators, being possible to use in intermediate stages when a ventilator is not yet needed;
 
Minimizes the risk of contamination, facilitating quarantine and self-isolation;

It is easily monitorized, not only the chamber conditions ut also the patient health state, using a mobile app with a version for doctors and other for the patient.
